# Getting Started

When you open Gnucash for Android for the first time, you are prompted to create some accounts from the default list of Accounts. The **Income** and **Expenses** accounts are checked by default.

When you select which accounts to create, you are taken to the accounts list view. In this view, you can see a summary of each account and the sum total of each account. The sum total is green for accounts which are in positive, and red for accounts which are, well, in the red. The main features visible in the accounts list are as follows

1. "Add Account" - Use this to add a new account
2. Account name - The names of the accounts are displayed first
3. Account sum - This is the sum total of transactions for this account. 
4. "Add Transaction" - Allows you to quickly add a new transaction to the account
